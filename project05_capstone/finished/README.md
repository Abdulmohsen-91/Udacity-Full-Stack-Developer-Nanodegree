## API Documentation

Here you can find all existing endpoints, which methods can be used, how to work with them & example responses youÂ´ll get.

Additionally, common pitfalls & error messages are explained, if applicable.

### Base URL

Since this API is not hosted on a specific domain, it can only be accessed when
`flask` is run locally. To make requests to the API via `curl` or `postman`,
you need to use the default domain on which the flask server is running.

**_http://127.0.0.1:8080/_**

### Available Endpoints

Here is a short table about which ressources exist and which method you can use on them.

                          Allowed Methods

# <a name="get-actors"></a>
### 1. GET /actors

Query paginated actors.

Fetch example:
```bash
$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000//actors?page1
```
- Fetches a list of dictionaries of examples in which the keys are the ids with all available fields
- Request Arguments: 
    - **integer** `page` (optional, 10 actors per page, defaults to `1` if not given)
- Request Headers: **None**
- Returns: 
  1. List of dict of actors with following fields:
      - **integer** `id`
      - **string** `name`
      - **string** `gender`
      - **integer** `age`
  2. **boolean** `success`

#### Example response
```js
{
  "success": true
}

```
#### Errors
If you try fetch a page which does not have any actors, you will encounter an error which looks like this:

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000//actors?page123124
```

will return

```js
{
  "error": 404,
  "message": "no actors found in database.",
  "success": false
}

```
