# FSND Full-Stack-Developer Project Submissions

Portfolio of Projects from the Udacity-FSND.

Successor of my first Udacity Nanodegree [Intro to Programming](https://github.com/Thalrion/Udacity-Intro-to-Programming-Nanodegree).

### Project 1: Booking Site Fy-yur

est. time spent: `32 hours` (including pre-courses)

Aim of the project was to build a full-stack Web App with Flask and Boostrap which enables
Venues & Artists to list themselves and arrange Shows together.

Used tech stack:
- SQLAlchemy ORM as ORM library of choice
- PostgreSQL as database
- Python3 and Flask for server language and framework
- Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Bootstrap 3

Applied concepts:
- How to use Git Bash & Github as version control tool
- Configure local database and connect it to a web application
- Create Model Schemas with columns and relationships (1:1, 1:n and N:N)
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL to query, insert, edit & delete Data
- Use WTForms to encapsulate input forms in seperate file & to allow for custom validations
- Use Boostrap as a simple to use Front End Libary and Ajax to fetch flask routes
- Create SQL-like Queries, but without any SQL syntax, only using SQLAlchemy ORM
- How to clearly structurize a larger web application in different files & folders

### Project 2: Trivia API

est. time spent: `36 hours` (including pre-courses)

Using 'Flask' and 'React', created a Full-Stack App to manage questions
for different categories & develop an API to power the Quiz Gameplay.

Used tech stack:
- React Components as frontend (mainly provided by Udacity Team)
- Python3 and Flask for server language and API development
- `cors` to handle access to the API
- `unittest` for automated testing of APIs
- `curl` to get responses from API
- `README.md` to document project setup & API endpoints

Applied concepts:
- using best-practice `PEP8-style` to design and structur code
- `test-driven-development (TDD)` to rapidly create highly tested & maintainable endpoints.
- directly test and make response to any endpoint out there with `curl`.
- implement `errorhandler` to format & design appropiate error messages to client
- becoming aware of the importance of extensive project documentation & testing.
