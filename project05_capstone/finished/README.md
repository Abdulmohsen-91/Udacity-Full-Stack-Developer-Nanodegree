## API Documentation

Here you can find all existing endpoints, which methods can be used, how to work with them & example responses youÂ´ll get.

### Base URL

`flask` is run locally. To make requests to the API via `curl` or `postman`,
you need to use the default domain on which the flask server is running.

**_http://127.0.0.1:8080/_**
