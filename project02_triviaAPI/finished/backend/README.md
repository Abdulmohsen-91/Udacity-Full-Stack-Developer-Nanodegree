1.  Start Project locally.
2.  API Documentation

## Start Project locally

Make sure that you `cd` into the backend folder before following the setup steps.
Also, you need the latest version of 

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```bash
  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided.
    ```bash
    $ psql trivia < trivia.psql
    ```

4. Run the development server:
  ```bash 
  $ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ flask run
  ```

>_tip_: Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

5. Testing
To run the tests, run
```bash 
$ dropdb trivia_test
$ createdb trivia_test
$ psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
$ python test_flaskr.py
```
